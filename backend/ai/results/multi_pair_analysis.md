- **Runtime**: 60 seconds per token pair
- **Mode**: Mainnet Fork
- **DEXes Tested**: Uniswap V3, Sushiswap, Curve, Balancer, 1inch
- **Networks**: Ethereum

## Performance Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Token Pairs Tested | 10 |
| Average Success Rate | 23.64% |
| Best Performing Pair | AAVE-WETH (34.78%) |
| Worst Performing Pair | WETH-USDC (15.69%) |
| Average Expected Profit | $-1403.80 |
| Average Confidence Score | 0.4769 |
| Average Execution Time | 115.17 ms |

## Token Pair Performance Ranking

1. **AAVE-WETH**: 34.78% success rate, $-1409.34 expected profit
2. **WBTC-WETH**: 32.79% success rate, $-1142.30 expected profit
3. **UNI-USDC**: 28.41% success rate, $-1682.97 expected profit
4. **COMP-USDC**: 25.00% success rate, $-1099.37 expected profit
5. **LINK-USDC**: 24.29% success rate, $-1282.05 expected profit
6. **WETH-DAI**: 24.10% success rate, $-1343.79 expected profit
7. **SNX-WETH**: 18.56% success rate, $-1928.97 expected profit
8. **WBTC-USDC**: 16.95% success rate, $-1701.63 expected profit
9. **YFI-WETH**: 15.79% success rate, $-1031.62 expected profit
10. **WETH-USDC**: 15.69% success rate, $-1415.92 expected profit

## Key Findings

1. **WETH-based pairs perform better**: Token pairs that include WETH tend to have higher success rates, particularly when paired with DeFi tokens like AAVE.

2. **Unexpected WETH-USDC performance**: Despite being one of the most liquid pairs, WETH-USDC showed the lowest success rate, suggesting that high liquidity may lead to more efficient pricing and fewer arbitrage opportunities.

3. **Negative expected profit**: All token pairs showed negative expected profit, indicating that gas costs are currently outweighing potential arbitrage gains.

4. **Confidence scores**: Confidence scores averaged around 0.48, with COMP-USDC and YFI-WETH showing the highest confidence despite not having the highest success rates.

5. **Execution time consistency**: Execution times were relatively consistent across all token pairs, averaging around 115 ms, which is acceptable for high-frequency trading.

## Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Focus on AAVE-WETH and WBTC-WETH**: Prioritize these pairs in the initial deployment as they showed the highest success rates.

2. **Gas optimization**: Implement more aggressive gas optimization strategies to reduce transaction costs and improve profitability.

3. **Confidence score calibration**: Recalibrate the confidence scoring algorithm, as higher confidence scores did not consistently correlate with higher success rates.

### Medium-term Strategy

1. **Dynamic pair selection**: Implement a dynamic token pair selection algorithm that adapts to changing market conditions.

2. **Multi-hop arbitrage**: Explore multi-hop arbitrage opportunities that may offer better profitability than direct pairs.

3. **Gas price strategies**: Develop more sophisticated gas price strategies that balance execution probability with cost.

### Long-term Vision

1. **Cross-chain expansion**: Extend testing to other chains like Arbitrum and Polygon, which may offer lower gas costs and different arbitrage opportunities.

2. **MEV protection enhancement**: Strengthen MEV protection mechanisms to prevent front-running of profitable trades.

3. **AI model refinement**: Continue refining the AI model with real-world data to improve prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

The multi-pair test provides valuable insights into the performance characteristics of different token pairs in the ArbitrageX system. While no pair currently shows positive expected profit, the relative performance differences suggest clear directions for optimization.

By focusing on the best-performing pairs and implementing the recommended improvements, the ArbitrageX system can move toward profitability. The consistent execution times across all pairs indicate that the system's performance is reliable, which is a positive foundation for further development.

The next phase should focus on gas optimization and refining the AI model to improve profitability while maintaining the system's speed and reliability.
