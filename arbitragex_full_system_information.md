- Identifies patterns and correlations in market data
- Generates feature sets for different model types

### 3. Model Training

- Trains multiple model types:
  - Profit predictor: Estimates potential profit for opportunities
  - Gas optimizer: Optimizes gas usage for transactions
  - Network selector: Selects optimal network for execution
  - Time optimizer: Identifies optimal timing for trades
- Uses various algorithms including XGBoost, LightGBM, and neural networks
- Implements early stopping and model checkpointing for optimal performance

### 4. Strategy Adaptation

- Dynamically adjusts trading strategies based on model outputs
- Updates network priorities based on performance
- Adapts validation thresholds to market conditions
- Optimizes gas strategies for changing network conditions

### 5. Performance Tracking

- Monitors model performance metrics (accuracy, MAE, R²)
- Tracks strategy performance over time
- Analyzes trade success rates and profitability
- Identifies areas for improvement

## Integration Points

  - `/api/v1/trades/stats`: Get trade statistics
  - `/api/v1/trades/execute`: Execute a trade manually

### 2. Data Flow

- **Execution Results** → **Learning Loop** → **Model Updates** → **Strategy Adaptation** → **Execution Parameters**
- **Market Data** → **Feature Extraction** → **Model Training** → **Prediction** → **Trade Execution**
- **Network Conditions** → **Gas Optimization** → **Transaction Parameters** → **Execution**

### 3. Configuration

- **Environment Variables** (`.env`):
  - Network RPC URLs
  - Token addresses
  - API ports
  - Execution mode
  
- **Hardhat Configuration** (`hardhat.config.ts`):
