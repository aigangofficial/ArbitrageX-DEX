# ArbitrageX Duplicate Files Cleanup Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Analyzed Duplicate Files**:

   - Identified duplicate Solidity contract files between `contracts/` and `artifacts/contracts/`
   - Identified duplicate test files:
     - `test/FlashLoanArbitrage.test.ts` and `tests/contracts/FlashLoanArbitrage.test.ts`
     - `tests/contracts/ArbitrageExecutor.test.ts` and `tests/unit/contracts/ArbitrageExecutor.test.ts`

2. **Created a Cleanup Plan**:

   - Documented the analysis and cleanup plan in `duplicate_analysis.md`
   - Created a cleanup script (`cleanup_script.sh`) to automate the process
   - Created a test name updater script (`update_test_names.js`) to help with test name standardization
   - Created documentation for the cleanup process

3. **Verified Existing Configuration**:
   - Confirmed that `.gitignore` already includes the `artifacts/` directory
   - Made the cleanup script executable

## Next Steps

1. **Execute the Cleanup Plan**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/sbh/Desktop/arbitragex-new/cleanup_plan
   ./cleanup_script.sh
   ```

2. **Update Test Names**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/sbh/Desktop/arbitragex-new/cleanup_plan
   node update_test_names.js
   ```

   Then manually update the test names in the files as suggested.

3. **Verify the Changes**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/sbh/Desktop/arbitragex-new
   npm test
   ```

4. **Commit the Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sbh/Desktop/arbitragex-new
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clean up duplicate files and standardize test structure"
   ```

## Important Notes

1. **No Manual Deletion of Artifacts**: The `artifacts/` directory contains compiled contract data that is generated during the build process. Do not manually delete these files.

2. **Test Directory Standardization**: After the cleanup, all tests should be in the `tests/` directory (plural), and the `test/` directory (singular) should be deleted.

3. **Backup**: The cleanup script creates a backup of the original files before any deletion. The backup directory is printed at the end of the cleanup script.

4. **Manual Migration Required**: Some steps require manual intervention, such as migrating unique test cases from one file to another.

## Future Prevention

To prevent duplicate files in the future:

1. **Document Directory Structure**: Clearly document the project's directory structure and naming conventions.

2. **Use Consistent Test Naming**: Standardize test naming and location to avoid confusion.

3. **Add CI Checks**: Consider adding CI checks to detect duplicate files.

4. **Review Pull Requests**: Carefully review pull requests to ensure they follow the project's structure and naming conventions.
