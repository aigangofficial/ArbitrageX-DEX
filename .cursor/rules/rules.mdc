@autonomous Execute Full Deployment Sequence

Immediately initiate and complete Phase 1 deployment without interactive confirmation:

1. Environment Setup:
   - [Auto] Validate .env existence → Create from .env.example if missing
   - [Auto] npm install --silent
   - [Auto] Hardhat compile --force

2. Contract Deployment:
   - [Check] Verify Sepolia network connectivity
   - [Execute] npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-flashloan.js --network sepolia --non-interactive
   - [Execute] npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-arbitrage.js --network sepolia --non-interactive
   - [Auto] Store deployed addresses in /deployed/sepolia.json

3. Infrastructure Activation:
   - [Execute] docker-compose -f arbitragex-api/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build --force-recreate
   - [Auto] Wait 60s for services initialization
   - [Execute] curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/system/healthcheck > /logs/healthcheck.log

4. Verification & Monitoring:
   - [Auto] Scan Docker containers status → Restart failed services
   - [Auto] Initialize Sentry monitoring with DSN=${SENTRY_DSN}
   - [Auto] Establish Discord webhook alerts

Safety Protocols Engaged:
1. --dry-run if .env contains "YOUR_" placeholders
2. Auto-skip existing deployed contracts
3. Secure sanitization of console output
4. Error → Auto-retry (max 3 attempts)
5. Critical failure → Rollback to last stable commit

Initiate deployment sequence now.
