# 🛠️ ArbitrageX Workflow

## Multi-Phase Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Conceptualization & Architecture
- **Objective**: Solidify the vision & architecture for an unstoppable arbitrage bot
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Map out the AI pipeline (ML, reinforcement learning, competitor analysis)
  2. Initialize Hardhat, set up base project structure, confirm multi-chain goals
- **Milestones**:
  - Project scaffolding in place
  - High-level ML strategy and competitor exploitation plan drafted

### Phase 2 – Data Harvesting & Mainnet Fork Setup
- **Objective**: Gather real data for AI training & spin up a mainnet fork
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Use `historical_data_fetcher.py` to collect 6+ months of trade data
  2. Configure Hardhat to replicate Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, etc.
  3. Load data into `datasets/` for model prototyping
- **Milestones**:
  - Full historical dataset ready for ML
  - Local environment mimics real block states

### Phase 3 – AI Training & Simulation
- **Objective**: Train the bot on the fork using reinforcement learning
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Run iterative simulations in `trainingMode.ts`
  2. Collect performance metrics (PnL, success rate, gas usage)
  3. Integrate competitor behavior analysis
- **Milestones**:
  - 80%+ profitable trades in simulated environments
  - Automated gas & slippage adjustments

### Phase 4 – Mainnet Launch & Flash Loan Integration
- **Objective**: Deploy to real network for live arbitrage
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Deploy smart contracts using `deploy.ts`
  2. Connect to flash loan providers
  3. Implement private mempool integration
- **Milestones**:
  - First successful real-money trade
  - Steady daily net profit

### Phase 5 – Multi-Chain Scaling & Competitor Decoys
- **Objective**: Expand to more networks and manipulate competitors
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Implement auto-switch logic for multiple chains
  2. Deploy decoy trades to manipulate competitors
  3. Evaluate quantum-safe submission strategies
- **Milestones**:
  - $1M+ daily arbitrage profits
  - Effective competitor manipulation

### Phase 6 – Full AI Autonomy & Evolution
- **Objective**: Achieve complete self-maintenance
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Integrate code self-modification capabilities
  2. Distribute AI logic across regions
  3. Implement ongoing GAN training
- **Milestones**:
  - Minimal human oversight required
  - Market dominance achieved

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- All code must pass linting and tests
- Smart contracts require 100% test coverage
- AI models must achieve minimum 85% accuracy

### Security
- Regular security audits required
- MEV protection mechanisms mandatory
- Multi-sig controls for critical functions

### Performance
- Sub-second execution time required
- Gas optimization for all transactions
- Minimum 99.9% uptime target

## Deployment Process
