# TypeScript to Python Migration

This document explains the process of migrating the ArbitrageX project from TypeScript to Python.

## Overview

The ArbitrageX project was originally built with a mix of TypeScript and Python. This migration aims to fully transition the project to Python for better consistency and to leverage Python's strengths in data science, machine learning, and blockchain integration.

## Migration Process

The migration is handled by the following scripts:

1. `scripts/remove_typescript.py`: Removes all TypeScript files from the project
2. `scripts/replace_typescript_files.py`: Replaces key TypeScript files with Python equivalents
3. `scripts/migrate_to_python.py`: Main script that orchestrates the migration process

To run the migration:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_python.py
```

## Key Components Migrated

### API Server

The TypeScript Express server (`backend/api/server.ts`) has been replaced with a Python Flask server (`backend/api/server.py`). The new server provides:

- All the same API endpoints as the original
- MongoDB and Redis integration
- WebSocket support
- Prometheus metrics
- Sentry error tracking
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Database Connector

The TypeScript database connector has been replaced with a Python MongoDB connector (`backend/bot/database_connector.py`). The new connector provides:

- Connection to MongoDB
- Methods for saving and retrieving market data
- Methods for saving and retrieving arbitrage opportunities
- Methods for saving and retrieving trades
- Error handling and reconnection logic

## Dependencies

The Python implementation requires the following dependencies:

- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- PyMongo
- Redis
- Prometheus Client (optional)
- Sentry SDK (optional)
- Web3.py
- TensorFlow (for AI components)

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Testing

After migration, you should test the Python implementation to ensure it works as expected:

1. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python backend/api/server.py
   ```

2. Test the API endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

3. Run the network scanner:
   ```bash
   python backend/bot/network_scanner.py
   ```

## Known Issues

- Some shell scripts may still reference TypeScript files. These should be updated manually if the automatic updates missed them.
- The frontend still uses TypeScript/React. This migration only covers the backend components.
- Some configuration files (tsconfig.json, etc.) are still present but no longer needed.

## Next Steps

After migration:

1. Remove any remaining TypeScript configuration files
2. Update documentation to reflect the Python-only backend
3. Consider migrating the frontend to a Python-based solution if desired
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to use Python tools instead of TypeScript tools
